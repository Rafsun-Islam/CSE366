# Viva Selection System

This Python script randomly selects students from a list of IDs for viva sessions. It reads the student IDs from a file, selects students one by one, and logs each selection. The script also ensures that no student is selected more than once.

## Features

- **Read Student IDs from File**: The script reads a list of student IDs from a file, handles errors if the file does not exist or is empty.
- **Random Selection**: Randomly selects students for viva.
- **Logging**: Logs each student's selection along with a viva count in a log file (`viva_selection_log.txt`).
- **Error Handling**: Handles cases where the file is missing, empty, or there are no valid IDs to select.

## Files

- `student_ids.txt`: A text file containing student IDs, one per line.
- `viva_selection_log.txt`: A log file generated by the script, recording each viva selection.

## Functions

### `read_student_ids(filename)`

Reads student IDs from a file and returns them as a list.

**Parameters**:

- `filename` (str): The name of the file containing student IDs.

**Returns**:

- List of student IDs (or an empty list if there is an error).

### `select_students_for_viva(student_ids)`

Randomly selects students for viva and logs each selection.

**Parameters**:

- `student_ids` (list): List of student IDs to select from.

**Returns**:

- An empty list after all students have been selected.

### `main()`

The main function that reads student IDs from the file, initiates the viva selection process, and logs the results.

## How to Use

1. Prepare a file called `student_ids.txt` containing student IDs, one ID per line. Example of student ID format: `2021-3-60-024`.
2. Run the script.
3. The script will randomly select students for viva and log each selection to a file called `viva_selection_log.txt`.

## Example

1. `student_ids.txt`:

   ```
   2021-3-60-024
   2021-3-60-025
   2021-3-60-026
   2021-3-60-027
   2021-3-60-028
   ```

2. When you run the script, it will output something like:

   ```
   Viva #1: 2021-3-60-025
   Viva #2: 2021-3-60-027
   Viva #3: 2021-3-60-028
   Viva #4: 2021-3-60-024
   Viva #5: 2021-3-60-026
   ```

3. The log file (`viva_selection_log.txt`) will contain:

   ```
   Viva Selection Log
   ------------------
   Viva #1: 2021-3-60-025
   Viva #2: 2021-3-60-027
   Viva #3: 2021-3-60-028
   Viva #4: 2021-3-60-024
   Viva #5: 2021-3-60-026
   ```
