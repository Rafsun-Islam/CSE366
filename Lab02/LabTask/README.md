# Modified Code for Conditional tobuy Assignment

This code has been modified to fulfill the following conditions:

- If the `last_price` is less than 70% of the average (`ave`) and the `instock` quantity is less than 30, then set `tobuy` to 15.
- Otherwise, if the `instock` quantity is less than 10, set `tobuy` to 5.
- If none of the above conditions apply, set `tobuy` to 0.
